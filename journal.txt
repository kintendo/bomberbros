TODO: handle menu/presentation

flames block on walls now
game runs relatively slow...
crates are working, now need drops
bug: two bombs one spot
bug: flames disappear too quickly

map is for blocking tiles only, so no players
no such thing as assoc arr, they're objects
use delete to del assoc arr objects
passing flame as coordinates per send map, wise choice?
flames work! but go through walls....

7/19/2013
decided to pass obj in addition to map
thought: how to handle disconnects?
bombs are hard...

7/18/2013
$(document) not $("document"), to refer to doc obj
i can move right one space. why can't i move more
because i moved them on map but not in themselves
anyway yay i can move around!
next: test plant bomb
thought: move to passing obj instead of map?

7/17/2013
blocks are drawn! yay for math!
next: movement
why isn't keypress working

7/16/2013
forgot @ to call class functions w/in class
also! jquery # can't fetch canvas, needs the [0]

7/14/2013
note: of vs. in! of used for objs vs. in for arr

7/12/2013
forgot how to get rolling w/ socket & coffee
npm install socket.io
npm install coffee-script
added index/app/server/package files
don't forget, git commit then push!
starting to create some classes...
