map is for blocking tiles only, so no players
no such thing as assoc arr, they're objects

passing flame as coordinates per send map, wise choice?

$(document) not $("document"), to refer to doc obj
i can move right one space. why can't i move more
because i moved them on map but not in themselves
anyway yay i can move around!
next: test plant bomb
thought: move to passing obj instead of map?
